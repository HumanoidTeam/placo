# PlaCo

PlaCo is Rhoban's planning and control library.
Its main features are:

* Inverse Kinematics with constraints,
* Inverse Dynamics with constraints,
* QP problem formulation,
* Built on the top of [pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio)
* Written in C++ with Python bindings

*Inverse Kinematics Example: a quadruped robot hitting targets with a leg while keeping its three legs on the ground*
