Installation using PIP
======================

PlaCo is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/placo/>`_ and can be installed with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install placo

If a wheel with pre-built binaries is available for your architecture, it will be downloaded as-is.
Else, it will be built on-the-fly (based on `cmeel <https://cmeel.readthedocs.io/>`_).
